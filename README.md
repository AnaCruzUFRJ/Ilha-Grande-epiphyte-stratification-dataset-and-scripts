# Ilha-Grande-epiphyte-stratification-dataset-and-scripts
Analysis of the vertical stratification of epiphytes in the Atlantic Forest of Ilha Grande, Brazil
The objective was to verify how vascular epiphytes are distributed along the vertical gradient of forests. 
In addition, we analyzed whether the pattern is maintained in forests with distinct characteristics and in the main families. 
The study was carried out in the Atlantic Forest of Ilha Grande, coast of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and included epiphytes, hemiepiphytes and nomadic vines.
